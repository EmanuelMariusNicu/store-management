The Store Management App was created as Portfolio Project #3 (Python Essentials) for Diploma in Full Stack Software Development at Code Institute. It allows users to simulate/manage an online shoping cart while they can view products, add to cart, remove from cart,apply discounts, pay and print receipts.

# 1. Project
##  Strategy/Scope

I chose to develop an application that can be used in real life. Home Library allows users to manage their personal book libraries. Application offers such functionalities as: viewing book database, adding/editing and removing books. User can display details of every database entry and also sort database in chosen order.

Application should have clean and intuitive user interface and offer easy access and navigation to all functionalities.

To achieve the strategy goals I implemented following features:

- clean user interface for easy navigation and readability,
- menu with easy acces to all features and possibility to exit program,
- colours in terminal to give user feedback depends on his actions,
- reliable and quick connection with database provided by Google,
- customised terminal display page for better visual experience,

## Site owner goals

As a program owner/developer I would like to:
- create application that has real life usage,
- create application that is easy to use and intuitive to navigate,
- create application with clean, good looking and accesible interface,
- provide user a feedback to every input and action,
- decide what kind of user input is allowed and valid,
- create bug free application.

##  External user's goal

As a user I would like to:
- be able to clearly understand application's purpose from the first contact,
- be able to use program in real life,
- be able to easily navigate the program and access all features,
- be able to receive feedback to actions taken,
- be able to decide what to do next, what features to use,
- be able to quit program,
- avoid any errors/bugs during using the app.
